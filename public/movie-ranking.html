<h3>A Beautiful Mind</h3>
<p>This movie spoke to me because it was the story of how one can decide to be well, even
   when one has an incurable illness. I also love (spoiler alert) the way the movie
   tricked me, and the reveal that made me want to watch the whole movie over again.
   This will be a theme in all of my favorite movies.

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>This movie stars one of the most versatile actors I know, Amy Adams. Everything she does
   turns to gold. It houses a great surprise reveal, and the story is beautiful and moving.

<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>This movie makes you say, "Whaaaaa?" right from the start. And then, as the situation 
   slowly reveals itself, you recognize one of the most cleverly thought out science-fiction 
   ideas that there is.
